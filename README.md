An instance of the Passport Application Smart Contract's workflow starts in the:

<b>MakeAppointment</b> state when an applicant successfully select an appointment schedule and filled up an online application form. 

The state changes to <b>PersonalAppearance</b> when the applicant paid the application fee. The application fee is currently set to <b>80 CRS</b>. The smart contract will hold the payment until the state set either to <b>ApprovedApplication</b>, <b>RejectedApplication</b>, or <b>CancelledApplication</b> state.

The applicant have a chance to cancel his/her appointment when the current state is <b>MakeAppointment</b> or <b>PersonalAppearance</b> but there is a penalty of <b>8 CRS</b>. After cancelling an appointment,  the applicant will only receive <b>72 CRS</b>, the provider will receive the <b>8 CRS</b> and the state will be set to <b>CancelledApplication</b> state.

When the current state is in <b>PersonalAppearance</b>, the provider/passport government agency could approve the applicant's application. If the provider approves the application, the smart contract will transfer the payment (80 CRS) to provider's address and the state will set to <b>ApprovedApplication</b> state and the process completed.

When the current state is in <b>PersonalAppearance</b>, the provider/passport government agency could reject the applicant's application. If the provider rejects the application, the smart contract will transfer 8 CRS as processing fee to provider's address and 72 CRS to applicant's the state will set to <b>RejectedApplication</b> state and the process completed.
